# Be Class copy

Edit `content.json` only. Do not put student names, rosters, emails, phones, grades, RSVPs, baptism lists, prayer requests, or follow-up notes in this folder.

Leave a string as `""` when Notion does not have it. The page shows an empty state. Do not guess a time, room, campus, teacher, or dress code.

`formUrl` must be a real `https://` church form, or `""`. An empty value keeps the buttons and shows “Form link not set.” The app does not collect names.
